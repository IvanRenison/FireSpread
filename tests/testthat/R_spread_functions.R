#' @title spread_one_cell_r
#' @description Calculates the probability of a cell spreading fire to another.

#'
#' @param int vegetation: vegetation class of the target cell, to obtain the
#'   corresponding intercept from coef.
#' @param arma::frowvec landscape_burning: data from burning cell.
#' @param arma::frowvec landscape_neighbour: data from target neighbour.
#' @param arma::frowvec coef: logistic regression parameters.
#' @param int position: relative position of the neighbour in relation to the
#' burning cell. The eight neighbours are labelled from 0 to 7 beginning from
#' the upper-left one (by row):
#'   0 1 2
#'   3   4
#'   5 6 7.
#'   This is necessary to compute the slope and wind effects, as they
#'   depend on the angle and distance between burning and target pixels.
#' @param float upper_limit: upper limit for spread probability (setting to
#'   1 makes absurdly large fires; 0.5 is preferred).

#' @title simulate_fire_r
#' @description function to simulate a fire spread given the landscape,
#'   model coefficients and ignition points.
#' @return burned_res: struct containing the following objects:
#'   IntegerMatrix burned_bin, a binary matrix indicating the burned pixels
#'   IntegerMatrix burned_ids, a matrix with a column by burned pixel,
#'     indicating its row (row1) and column (row2) in the landscape,
#'   int end, the number of burned pixels.

#' @param SpatRaster[terra] landscape: predictor variables or variables used to
#'   compute the actual predictors.
#'     veg: vegetation class, in {0, 1, 2}. 99 is non-burnable. This layer is
#'       separated within the function.
#'     ndvi: ndvi-quadratic terms, computed as pi[v] * (ndvi - optim[v]) ^ 2.
#'       pi[forest] = 1, while the others are lower. pi and optim are
#'       estimated at
#'       <fire_spread/data/NDVI_regional_data/ndvi_optim_and_proportion.rds>.
#'     north: cos(aspect), weighted by slope steepness.
#'     elev: elevation (standardized), used to compute directional slope
#'       effect, but also included as a main effect.
#'     wdir: direction from where the wind blows (Â°),
#'     wspeed: wind speed (m/s).
#' @param IntegerMatrix ignition_cells(2, burning_cells): row and column id for
#'   the cell(s) where the fire begun. First row has the row_id, second row has
#'   the col_id.
#' @param arma::frowvec coef: parameters in logistic regression to compute the
#'   spread probability as a function of covariates.
#' @param float upper_limit: upper limit for spread probability (setting to
#'   1 makes absurdly large fires).
#' @param int steps: maximum number of simulation steps allowed. If 0
#'   (the default), a large number is used to avoid limiting fire spread.
#'   The burning of ignition points is considered the first step, so steps = 1
#'   burns only the ignition points. Bear in mind that the simulation may stop
#'   because there are no more burning cells, without reaching the maximum steps
#'   allowed.

#' @param bool plot_animation: whether to plot the fire progress while running
#'   or not (set to FALSE by default).
